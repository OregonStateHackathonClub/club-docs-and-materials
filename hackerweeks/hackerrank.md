# Getting Started
This document was created to help the HackerWeeks Coordinator create coding challenges on HackerRank.

## Coding Platform
There are several competitive coding platforms available that may be suitable to host weekly competitions. In August, 2020 I emailed several companies and only Code Chef was able to host our challenges but we decided to stay with HackerRank due to their poor user interface. 

[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) is currently the club's go-to site. It allows for custom competitions with private invite links and the ability to email all participants. It ranks the results by number of test cases passed and completion time.
* Account name: `oregonstatehack`
* Password: `Jellybean2020!`
* [An example contest](https://www.hackerrank.com/hackerweeks-1)
* Scoring must be carefully set up before the contest starts or winners cannot be determined.
* This [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19GkSvM68FLftOyGeB-hqthundBdVUTFMgXGeQ0dmtNo/edit) is for participants to register their HackerRank IDs for determining winners.


## Setting Up Contests
This is your [dashboard](https://www.hackerrank.com/administration/contests) for setting up and managing contests. When you create a contest, you will need to fill out the form on HackerRank with markdown content. Feel free to use this boiler plate content or create your own.
* Start time: this is generally set to 12 AM on the first Monday of the second week of the quarter. 
* End time: this is generally set to 11:59 PM on the following Sunday.


## Description
We chose to create a theme for this quarter but feel free to choose coding challenges at random.
`HackerWeeks coding competitions provide a fun way for students to sharpen their programming, interviewing, and problem solving skills while earning a little swag in the process. The focus for the fall 2020 challenges are data structures! Join us each week to compete, learn, and/or review a different data structure. Don't forget to check the osu-hackathon slack channel after each competition to share solutions and congratulate contest winners. Good luck and happy coding!`

## Prizes
Two prizes are awarded each competition. One prize is awarded in the beginner's category for the highest ranked student of the easy coding challenge that has not completed both 261 and 325 courses. The second prize is awarded in the advanced category to the highest ranked student to complete the medium/hard coding challenge.  
`A bit of OSU swag will be mailed to the first place winner of the beginner and advanced categories!`


## Rules
- Participants must be current students at Oregon State University.
- To qualify for the beginner category, a student has not completed both 261 (Data Structures) and 325 (Algorithms).
- Students that have taken both 261 and 325 can only win in the advanced category of the competition.
- Students must fill out this [form](https://bit.ly/3i1N6gW) in order to win.
- Participants must follow all rules from the OSU Student Code of Conduct.
- Cheating in any form is not allowed. This includes copy-pasting solutions from elsewhere, using multiple accounts to get better times, and any other methods that the contest administrators deem against the spirit of the competition.
