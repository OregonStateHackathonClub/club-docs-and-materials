# Getting Started
This document was created to help the HackerWeeks Coordinator create coding challenges on HackerRank.

## Coding Platform
There are several competetive coding platforms available that may be suitable to host weekly competitions. In August, 2020 I emailed several companies and only Code Chef was able to host our challenges but we decided to stay with HackerRank due to their poor user interface. 

[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) - this is currently the club's go-to site. It allows for custom competitions with private invite links and ranks the results by number of test cases passed and completion time.

* [An example contest](https://www.hackerrank.com/hackerweeks-1)
* Scoring must be carefully set up before the contest starts or winners cannot be determined
* This [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19GkSvM68FLftOyGeB-hqthundBdVUTFMgXGeQ0dmtNo/edit) is for participants to register their HackerRank IDs for determining winners


## Setting Up Contests
[Dashboard](https://www.hackerrank.com/administration/contests) - this is your dashboard for setting up and managing contests. When you create a contest, you will need to fill out a form on HackerRank with markdown content. Feel free to use this boiler plate content and/or make changes as needed.
