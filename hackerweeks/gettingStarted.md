# Getting Started
This document was created to help the HackerWeeks Coordinator create coding challenges on HackerRank.

## Coding Platform
There are several competitive coding platforms available that may be suitable to host weekly competitions. In August, 2020 several companies were investigated and only Code Chef was able to host our challenges but we chose to stay with HackerRank due to their poor user interface. 

[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) is currently the club's go-to site. It allows for custom competitions with private invite links and the ability to email all participants. It ranks the results by number of test cases passed and completion time.
* Account name: `oregonstatehack`
* Password: `Jellybean2020!`
* [An example contest](https://www.hackerrank.com/hackerweeks-1)
* Scoring must be carefully set up before the contest starts or winners cannot be determined.
* This [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19GkSvM68FLftOyGeB-hqthundBdVUTFMgXGeQ0dmtNo/edit) is for participants to register their HackerRank IDs for determining winners.

## Setting Up Contests
This is your [dashboard](https://www.hackerrank.com/administration/contests) for setting up and managing contests. When you create a contest, you will need to fill out the form on HackerRank with markdown content. Feel free to use this boiler plate content or create your own. In order to make scoring the contests easier, it is advised to create two separate competitions: beginner and advanced.
* Contest Name- Beginner Competition: Arrays (as an example, this will become your url)
* Start time: this is generally set to 12 AM on the first Monday of the second week of the quarter. 
* End time: this is generally set to 11:59 PM on the subsequent Sunday.
* FYI: you can create up to four competitions in advance.

## Description
We chose to create a theme for this quarter but feel free to choose coding challenges however you prefer.  
`HackerWeeks coding competitions provide a fun way for students to sharpen their programming, interviewing, and problem solving skills while earning a little swag in the process. The focus for the fall 2020 challenges are data structures! Join us each week to compete, learn, and/or review a different data structure. Don't forget to check the osu-hackathon slack channel after each competition to share solutions and congratulate contest winners. Good luck and happy coding!`

## Prizes
Two prizes are awarded each competition. One prize is awarded in the beginner's category for the highest ranked student of the easy coding challenge that has not completed both 261 and 325 courses. The second prize is awarded in the advanced category to the highest ranked student to complete the medium/hard coding challenge.  
`A bit of OSU swag will be mailed to the first place winner of the beginner and advanced categories!`

## Rules
- Participants must be current students at Oregon State University.
- To win the beginner category, a student must not have completed 325 (Algorithms).
- Any student may win the advanced category.
- Students must fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19GkSvM68FLftOyGeB-hqthundBdVUTFMgXGeQ0dmtNo/viewform?) in order to win.
- Participants must follow all rules from the [OSU Code of Student Conduct](https://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/sites/studentlife.oregonstate.edu/files/student-conduct-community-standards/Code/code_of_student_conduct_8_14_20.pdf).
- Cheating in any form is not allowed. This includes copy-pasting solutions from elsewhere, using multiple accounts to get better times, and any other methods that the contest administrators deem against the spirit of the competition.

## The Coding Challenges
Each week select two coding challenges for each competition: easier problems for beginners and medium/hard problems for advanced students. It is possible to create your own challenge through HackerRank but submitting test cases is an arduous process. Be sure to check the codeChallenges.md file for previously used problems.

## Scoring
As stated previously, ensure Advanced Settings are set to this configuration otherwise winners cannot be determined.
* Leaderboard: "default HackerRank leaderboard."
* Tiebreaker: "sum of time of the first correct submission for all the problems."
* Time used for tiebreaking: "viewing individual challenge."

## Announcing the Competitions
Create an announcement and post on the Hackathon Club, COE, and Post-Bacc Slack Channels. You can also post to the OSU online post-bacc subReddit.
Example announcement:

Hackathon Club presents HackerWeeks Competition: Stacks  
Gear up for week two of the competition! We had an excellent turnout in week one, great job to all the participants.
- Our theme this fall is data structures.
- You'll have a week to complete two coding challenges.
- Winners of the beginner and advanced categories walk away with some sweet beaver swag!
- The beginner category includes students who have not completed Algorithms: [Beginner Competition: Linked Lists](https://www.hackerrank.com/hackerweeks-competition-linked-lists)
- Anyone can win the [Advanced Competition: Linked Lists](https://www.hackerrank.com/hackerweeks-competition-queues).
- In order to win, you must fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdo10z_RCLGy8tYkL20wGgKsNEA5NZF0q0bU4yieDvpGrbA6w/viewform) 

Don't forget to come back to share solutions! 
Good luck and Go Beavs!

## Announcing the Winners
After the competition is over, check the rankings of the top three participants for each competition. Cross-check the winners against the form that displays the participants HackerRank username and OSU username. Double check that the winner's of the beginner category selected that category on the form. Post the top three winners of each competition on the Hackathon Club, COE, and Post-Bacc Slack Channels. That may look something like this:
