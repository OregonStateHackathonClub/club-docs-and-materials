# Guide for the Local Chapter Coordinator
### General Information
The Local Chapter Coordinator manages the club's "local hackathon" program. Since the OSU Hackathon Club serves the online postbaccalaureate community of students as well as on-campus students, the Hackathon Club has members spread across the country/globe. Thus, we have a system for funding in place to sponsor localized in-person hackathons.
##### Responsibilities
 * Seek out groups interested in hosting club-sponsored hackathons
 * Set them up with the tools they need for sucess
    * Devpost
    * Funding
 * Serve as a point-of-contact to the club for local hackathon committees

### The program during COVID
In-person hackathons are not possible or wise right now. But there are still two main ways (that have been devised) for this program to still function.
 1. Sponsor "specialized" rather than "localized" hackathons. These would be specialty hackathons put on by those that may have a special type of hackathon in mind.
 2. Sponsor localized virtual hackathons. They're still local to a particular area, but they're held remotely

### Other OSU organizations that may have interest in hackathons
 * [Linux Users Group](https://lug.oregonstate.edu/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Oregon%20State,(FOSS)%20on%20campus.%22)
