  * You are the point-person in charge of planning such that it goes off smoothly
  * You are HIGHLY encouraged to delegate tasks and request help from fellow officers and/or general club membership
  * The quarterly hackathon is the club's core function. See the **What must be ready when the hackathon starts?** section below. Without these things completed, the hackathon cannot occur.

     * assign free agents to teams
       * assume those eligible to compete as new students want to compete on new student teams
